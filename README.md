I’m a passionate and curious developer with strong foundations in **Python** and web development. Currently, I’m in the final year of my CSE degree and actively exploring real-world development through internships and hands-on projects.

I’ve worked with tools like **React.js**, **Node.js**, **OpenAI API**, and **MySQL**, and I’m currently building my first major project — an **AI-Powered Chatbot** for real-time user interaction. I thrive on learning by doing, and I believe even the smallest project is a big step forward.
